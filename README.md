The purpose of this repository is to display my knowledge of linked lists, algorithm for shuffling, and writing 
tests. For this project I'm using Mocha, which is a JS test framework that runs on Node.js and an assertion 
library for Node.js called Chai.

In this repo I've created a deck of cards using linked lists. I've created the following methods: 

-Check if a deck is empty.
-Return the size of a deck.
-Print each node in the deck.
-Append new cards to the deck.
-Fill the deck.
-Shuffle the deck.
